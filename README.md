# Data-PreProcessing
This repository contains a collection of data preprocessing scripts, tools, and techniques used to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis and modeling
plit datasets into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The purpose of this operation is to prepare data for machine learning model training and evaluation.

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn library
Make sure to install the required library if you haven't already:

pip install scikit-learn  
Code Explanation
Imports
Before using the train_test_split function, ensure you have imported it from the sklearn.model_selection module:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
Data Preparation
The script assumes that you have two datasets:

X: Features of the dataset.
y: Target variable corresponding to the features.
Additionally, there are two other datasets:

Xgg: Another set of features.
ygg: Corresponding target variable for Xgg.
Splitting the Data
The script performs the following operations to split the datasets:

First Dataset Split:

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  
X_train: Training features for the first dataset.
X_test: Testing features for the first dataset.
y_train: Training target variable for the first dataset.
y_test: Testing target variable for the first dataset.
test_size=0.2: This indicates that 20% of the data will be used for testing, while 80% will be used for training.
random_state=42: This is a seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the results.
Second Dataset Split:

Xgg_train, Xgg_test, y_ggtrain, y_ggtest = train_test_split(Xgg, ygg, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  
Xgg_train: Training features for the second dataset.
Xgg_test: Testing features for the second dataset.
y_ggtrain: Training target variable for the second dataset.
y_ggtest: Testing target variable for the second dataset.
The parameters test_size and random_state are the same as in the first dataset split for consistency.
Usage
To use this script:

Ensure that your datasets X, y, Xgg, and ygg are defined and properly formatted.
Run the script to perform the data splitting.
Use the resulting training and testing datasets for your machine learning model.
